# ChamaLink - Digital Chama Management Platform

## Project Description

**Market Need**: Traditional chamas (investment groups) in Kenya rely on manual record-keeping, cash transactions, and in-person meetings, leading to inefficiencies, disputes over contributions, and limited financial transparency. With Kenya's mobile money adoption at over 80%, there's a significant opportunity to digitize chama operations.

**Project Value**: ChamaLink transforms how Kenyan investment groups operate by providing a comprehensive digital platform that automates contribution tracking, integrates M-Pesa payments, manages loans, and offers real-time financial insights. This reduces administrative burden, increases transparency, and enables chamas to scale their operations effectively.

**Key Benefits**:
- Automated M-Pesa integration for seamless contributions
- Real-time financial tracking and reporting
- Digital loan management with automated calculations
- Goal setting and progress visualization
- Reduced disputes through transparent record-keeping
- Mobile-first design for accessibility

## Target Users

- **Chama Members**: Individual participants who make contributions, apply for loans, and track their financial progress
- **Chama Treasurers**: Financial officers responsible for managing group funds, loan approvals, and financial reporting

### User Demographics
- **Geographic**: Kenya (with potential expansion to East Africa)
- **Age**: 25-55 years old
- **Income**: Middle to lower-middle class
