- A user-friendly mobile-first experience
- Integration with mobile money systems (M-Pesa)
- Transparent contribution and loan tracking
- Group communication and voting tools
- Free/freemium pricing for accessibility

These elements make MyChama ideal for both urban and rural Chamas looking to transition to digital platforms without sacrificing usability or trust.
