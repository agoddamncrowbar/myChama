# Problem Statement

Many Chamas (informal savings and investment groups) in Kenya still rely on manual tools such as notebooks, WhatsApp groups, and Excel spreadsheets to manage their activities. These traditional methods often result in:

- Poor record-keeping and data loss
- Limited transparency and trust among members
- Missed meetings or forgotten contributions
- Challenges in tracking loans, repayments, and overall group finances
- Miscommunication due to lack of centralized communication channels

As Chamas grow in membership and transaction volume, these manual processes become unsustainable and inefficient. Members and leaders struggle with accountability, financial oversight, and timely coordination of group activities.

## Solution Direction

MyChama aims to address these challenges by providing a centralized, digital platform for chama management. The solution will support:

- Secure digital recordkeeping
- Automated contribution and loan tracking
- Communication features such as announcements and polls
- Mobile money integration (e.g., M-Pesa)
- Event and meeting reminders
- Transparent reporting and financial dashboards

By digitizing chama operations, MyChama will promote accountability, enhance transparency, and empower members to manage their finances more effectively.
